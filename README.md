# Dokter.ai
Dokter.ai is a mobile-based application that can be easily installed by anyone, our application allows us to know a disease based on symptoms without having to interact directly with a real doctor. By inputting some of the symptoms the system has, the system tells a disease based on these symptoms. We want to provide AI-based health services to help people who want to consult about their health problems.
